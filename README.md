Axion
=====

Axion is an experimental CLI editor that combines Vim's keyboard-centric approach and ability to run entirely in a terminal with Acme's system integration and window management. Or, that's the plan at any rate. It isn't even close to finished yet.

The Plan
--------

- [ ] Use [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) to build a nice command-line interface.
- [ ] Keyboard input should work similarly to Vim, but with a few tweaks.
- [ ] Acme-like system integration, meaning that it relies on command-line tools on the system for handling anything beyond the basics.
- [ ] Acme-style window management, though possible with just the keyboard. Possibly the mouse later, too.
- [ ] Acme-style command buffer that can be easily navigated with the keyboard.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts that essentially map to Acme's middle and left clicks and operate on Vim's visual selections.
